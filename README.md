A simple and robust backend service for fetching weather data and managing a user's favorite locations.

## About The Project

This project is a backend API built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript. It provides endpoints for user authentication, fetching real-time weather data from an external source, and allowing authenticated users to save and manage a list of their favorite locations.

## üöÄ Live API

You can test the live, deployed API at the following base URL.

**Base URL:** `https://weather-api-s2e8.onrender.com/`

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which includes npm)
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```sh
    git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd <YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY>
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables**
    Copy the example environment file. Then, open the new `.env` file and add your secret keys (e.g., your own weather API key).

    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Your `.env` file should look like this:

    ```env
    PORT=3000
    API_WEATHER_KEY=your_secret_weather_api_key
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    ```

4.  **Build the project**
    This will compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript.

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

5.  **Run the server**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    The server should now be running locally on `http://localhost:3000`.
